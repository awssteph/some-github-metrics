# GitHub Metrics

**Notice:** `urllib` already migrated to `requests` library. 

## Step 1 - Intro

I created this repo to gather some metrics for the company I used to work.
Its purpose is to collect metrics around an organization repositories, such as commits, forks, stars etc.

I used [GitHubâ€™s REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [PyGitHub](http://pygithub.readthedocs.io) to develop the Python scripts.

In order to be able to run this project you have to

1) be a member of the organization you want to collect the metrics from
2) have a Github personal token (generate here: https://github.com/settings/tokens)

## Step 0 - Installing requirements

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment (I use [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
3. Activate your environment: `$ source [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Using the repo

There are 2 Python scripts. Their usage and purposes are described below.


## OPTICS

Update the repos.json with new repos we have.

python export_traffic_op.py -t <toeken> -o aws-samples


### FIRST SCRIPT

You execute the file on command line (terminal, bash, whatever you name it) by typing:
```
$ python github_metrics.py -t [GITHUB-TOKEN] -o [ORGANIZATION NAME]
```

And `github_metrics.py` script runs the functions:

**1) `list_orgs(token)`**

function that returns a list of the organizations the user belongs to.

**2) `list_org_members(org, token)`**

function that builds a list with the members of an organization inside GitHub. Only current members are listed. It returns one list with members names and other list with members logins (usernames).

**3) `export_code_frequency(directory, org, token)`**

function that gather statistics for all repositories in an organization, by week/user/repo, and returns a csv file with: name of the repository, week in question, number of additions, number of deletions, author of such commit and if the author is a member or not of the organization.

**4) `list_unique_collaborators(directory, org, token)`**

function that returns the number of unique collaborators of an organization (for all its repos), with the information if the collaborator is a member of the organization or not.

**5) `export_community_engagement(directory, org, token)`**

function that gather basic metrics for all repos of an organization, such as number of forks, stars, commits and collaborators. The function returns a csv file with these informations for each repo.

### SECOND SCRIPT

You execute the file on command line by typing:
```
$ python export_traffic.py -t [GITHUB-TOKEN] -o [ORGANIZATION NAME]
```

And `export_traffic.py` runs the functions:

**1) `test_push_access(org, token)`**

function that will check which repositories your token has push access to, inside the specified organization. It returns two lists: one with the repositories that the token doesn't have push access to, and other with the repos the token has access to.

**2) `export_traffic(directory, org, repos_ok, token)`**

function that exports the traffic from GitHub repos that your token has push access to, for the last 14 days. It will create a csv file for the following metrics: traffic (views), clones, paths and referrers. Please check [further documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/traffic/) from GitHub.

**3) `relevantrepos_noaccess(numstars, repos_noaccess, organization, authToken)`**

function that checks which repositories over `numstars` your token doesn't have access to, and returns a dictionary with the name of the repo and its number of stars.
